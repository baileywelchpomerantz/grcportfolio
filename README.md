# GRC Project Portfolio – Bailey Welch-Pomerantz
## Overview

This repository contains a curated portfolio of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) projects demonstrating hands-on experience with IT risk assessments, compliance gap analysis, internal controls, and audit-ready documentation.

All projects are based on real-world scenarios and aligned to industry-recognized frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST SP 800 series). Artifacts have been sanitized and anonymized to remove sensitive or proprietary information.

## Purpose:
To showcase practical GRC skills, analytical judgment, and documentation quality relevant to early-career GRC, IT Risk, and Security Compliance roles.

## What You’ll Find Here

### Each project includes:

- The problem or risk context

- The frameworks and standards applied

- My role and responsibilities

- The methodology used

- Key deliverables (sanitized)

- The outcome or decision enabled

_This mirrors how GRC work is performed and reviewed in professional environments._
